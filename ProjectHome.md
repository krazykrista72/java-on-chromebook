Be careful!!! This application will remove rootfs verification on your computer which means that you will NOT be able to boot in Verified mode!(dev-switch off) Proceed only if you know what you're doing. This has to be applied after every system update.


Enter Developer mode. There are millions of instructions for that over the Internet. After entering it press CTRL+ALT+F2 to enter the Developer shell. Enter "chronos" as username. Now as you are in the root shell, type these commands one by one and press enter after each one. The commands reboot the computer after execution so enter the shell again after each command(the first one is not necessary for CR-48 models). Be warned that you need to install Java again after every autoupdate.
